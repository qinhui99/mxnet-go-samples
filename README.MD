The samples are based on Mxnet and go-mxnet-predictor.  Therefore we need:

1. Mxnet .  https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet

2. go-mxnet-predictor. https://github.com/songtianyi/go-mxnet-predictor


We have three samples.

1. OXFORD 102 flower Model.  <br>
We can use it to classify 102 flowers .


2. Inception Model. <br>
The model comes from http://data.mxnet.io/mxnet/models/imagenet/inception-bn/<br>
We can use it to classify 1000 objects.


3. Iris dataset Model. <br>
Show how to classify iris dataset through go api.

To run the codes, you should:<br>
 git clone https://github.com/qinhui99/mxnet-go-samples
